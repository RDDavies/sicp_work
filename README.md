- Tree Accumulation is the process through which the results percolate upwards. Thinking about this, it is each subprocess combining to create an independent result. For example, if you were to attempt to calculate the wheel rate of a corner of a car, the branches are the square of the motion ratio, and the spring rate on the car, and the trunk is the wheel rate. The end branch will be primitives (direct numbers, names)
